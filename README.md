* **updateTags.sh**: A bash shell script to regenerate the tags file I use with vim

* **remasterPhotosPhotos:** An script that can be used to take a drive full of pictures to reorganize them. The script access the header information inside the image format to retrieve the day when the picture was taken. It uses it to rename the filename using the date and time, and create a Year >> Month directory structure. The pictures are copied at a different path/location without affecting the original directory.
